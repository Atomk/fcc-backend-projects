# Wikipedia Viewer

A page which lets you search for any article on Wikipedia or open a random article.

It works great but I'm still not sure if I used the correct API route, I've found Wikipedia API documentation a bit confusing (yes, I've read the API docs, no google shortcuts)

I tried to keep the design very minimal. 

## User stories
- I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
- I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

## To-do

Minor improvements I could work on:
- Check if I used the most suitable API route
- [issue] Tooltip stays visible if a button is clicked and stays selected (i.e. "Random article")
- Allow to load more than 10 results.
