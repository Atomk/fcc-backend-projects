# Tic Tac Toe

A responsive tic-tac-toe game. The IA isn't that bright, it still has to learn how to minimax.

## User stories

- I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## To-do

- Implement minimax algorithm for the IA
- [issue] When the user wins with two lines (i.e. one horizontal and one vertical) only one winning combination is highlighted
