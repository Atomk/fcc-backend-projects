Timestamp Microservice
=========================

A simple timestamp conversion API, from natural language to numbers and vice-versa.

Timestamps values **must be provided in milliseconds**, or you'll get wrong dates! If the conversion gives unexpected results try to add three zeros at the end of your timestamp.

User stories
-------------------

- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
