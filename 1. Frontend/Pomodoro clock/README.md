A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Atomk/pen/gwpRyq.

A timer for Pomodoro sessions. The design is inspired by the default Android timer.

I'm quite proud of it, however there's a few things I'd like to implement/fix at some point:
- You can stop the timer but you can't pause/resume it.
- When in mobile landscape view, the footer overlaps the stop button.
- There's no sound or notification on session end.
- The buttons to increase/decrease the minutes for the sessions do not change visually when the maximum/minimum value is reached.
