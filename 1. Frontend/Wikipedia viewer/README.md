A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Atomk/pen/jAJAxR.

A project for FreeCodeCamp, I tried to make it look really minimal. You can search for any article on Wikipedia or open a random article. It works great but I'm still not sure if I used the correct API route, I've found Wikipedia API documentation a bit confusing (yes, I've read the API docs, no stackoverflow magic)

Minor improvements I could work on:
- Check if I used the most suitable API route
- [issue] Tooltip stays visible if a button is clicked and stays selected (i.e. "Random article")
