# Javascript Calculator

Very basic, but at least it doesn't let you divide by zero.

At the moment operators' priority is not respected:
`1 + 1 x 5 = 10` (instead of `6`)

## User stories

- I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

## To-do

- Chain operators according to their priority (*, /, +, -)
