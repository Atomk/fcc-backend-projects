Just a copypaste of the solutions I wrote for the JavaScript algorithm challenges section.
Most were easy to be honest, but there are also some tough ones which required pen and paper and several hours of debug to solve.
I tried to add comments to explain everything that isn't plain obvious or easy to get info about.
I have a journal about the experience but it is not in English, unfortunately.

## To-do

- Redo the challenges in ES6.
